# PigeonKeepAlive
I wanted to make a simple yet sleek Keep Alive for Toontown since I think all of the other ones available are poorly made and look terrible. I present to you: Pigeon Keep Alive!

- Custom UI Design
- Uses the Toontown click sound effect when clicking any button.
- Uses the Toontown shticker book closing sound effect upon closing the program.
- "Start" button automatically detects all instances of Toontown Rewritten running and starts Pigeon Keep Alive.
- "Stop" button will stop Pigeon Keep Alive -- Pressing "Start" will automatically re-detect all opened Toontown Rewritten windows.
- "Options" tab takes you to a separate screen where you can edit your Pigeon Keep Alive key. Tapping any single key will auto-update and replace the last inserted key into the text box. Press "Apply" to confirm your Pigeon Keep Alive key.
- Your Pigeon Keep Alive Key will be saved even after exiting and re-opening the program.
- While "Start" is active, you may live update your key in the "Options" screen without needing to hit "Start" again.
- Pigeon Keep Alive will prevent your computer from entering Sleep mode.
- Pigeon Keep Alive will continue to keep your Toons awake even if minimized. It will also remain active if your game(s) are minimized as well.
